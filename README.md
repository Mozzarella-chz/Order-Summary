## My process
I am currently taking Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy.com. 
Midway through the CSS portion of learning when I figured I should just jump right in with some projects and get my feet wet. I watched a few different types of tutorials of this specific challenge on Youtube. Seeing different ways to code from a number of people was very helpful. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### Continued development

The concepts that I want to understand further are flex and media queries.
